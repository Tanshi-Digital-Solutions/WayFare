Usage
User Registration
To register a new user, use the createUser function. The system ensures each user has a unique code for identification.

Booking a Ticket
Users can book tickets through the booking page by providing trip details and selecting a payment method. The backend handles ticket creation and updates the user's account.

Viewing Past Tickets
Users can view their past tickets in the MyTickets page. The MyTicket component displays minimal ticket information, and clicking on a ticket shows detailed information using the TicketDetail component.

Agent Management
Agents can be created and managed with the createAgent and agentLogin functions. These functions ensure only authorized agents can access the system.
